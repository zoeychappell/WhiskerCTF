# Welcome to WhiskerCTF, a Capture the Flag themed around cats!

This CTF is primarily focused on using the Volatility Framework 3 for Linux memory analysis. 

# Flags: 
There are 13 flags in total. 
Each flag follows a consistent format
	CAT_(word relating to cats)_(random word)

	So an example flag would be: 
		CAT_CATNIP_WATER
	
The last word in the flag spells out a phrase. This phrase is the final deliverable. 
Look for patterns in the second word to determine the order of the flags. 

# Memory images: 

Two memory images are provided. One uses LiME to grab the memory, one uses AVML.
